It's been taken care of so no problems, but Daniele (DOTween's author) is trying to pinpoint it (it's very rare and he can't reproduce it) so it would be awesome if you could reproduce this log in a sample project and send it to him. Or even just write him the complete log that was generated by this message. Fixing this would make DOTween slightly faster. Thanks.

<color=#0099bc><b>DOTWEEN ► </b></color>Error in RemoveActiveTween (totActiveDefaultTweens < 0). It's been taken care of so no problems, but Daniele (DOTween's author) is trying to pinpoint it (it's very rare and he can't reproduce it) so it would be awesome if you could reproduce this log in a sample project and send it to him. Or even just write him the complete log that was generated by this message. Fixing this would make DOTween slightly faster. Thanks.
